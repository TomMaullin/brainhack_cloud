[{"body":"Overview Once a new project is requested via the Issue Template one of the admins has to provision the project on the cloud.\nHere is an example for such a request:\nOnce such a request comes in, assign it to yourself so that other people know that you are working on it!

Name it like the group just created and add the Github issue link as the description. Parent compartment is projects under brainhack (root).\nCreate Policy for group and compartment Go back to Identity and click on Policies. Click Create Policy. Name the policy like the group and compartment just created. The description is the Github issue link. You can either use the policy builder (Compartment Management -\u003e Let compartment admins manage the compartment) or switch to manual. The resulting policy needs to be Allow group REPLACEWITHGROUPNAME to manage all-resources in compartment REPALCEWITHCOMPARTMENTNAME. Make sure that the compartment “projects” is selected because we want this policy on the projects level (not in root!).\nCreate Budget for compartment Budgets help us to control and monitor costs. For every compartment, we need a budget with someone being alerted when things go wrong:\nGo to Budgets under Cost Management and click Create Budget. Add the project details (name and issue link as description), set the Budget to 1000 AUD, switch to Forecast Spend and set a threshold of 100% and add your email to the alert list + a second admin as backup.\nCleanup Go back to the Github issue and let the project know that everything is setup and close the issue.\n","categories":"","description":"Creating new users\n","excerpt":"Creating new users\n","ref":"/brainhack_cloud/admins/users/","tags":"","title":"Creating new users"},{"body":"Overview This section contains documentation on how to use the Oracle Cloud.\nFeedback \u0026 Inquiries To ask questions or suggest new features, join the discussion on github.
