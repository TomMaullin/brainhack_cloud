Let’s find the URL to the file we just uploaded: Click on the 3 dots next to the file and click on View Object details: When opening this URL, you will get this error: You can either make the WHOLE bucket visible to the world or use “Pre-Authenticated Requests”. Let’s start with the easy (and less control/secure) way first:\nClick on Edit Visibility and switch to public: Now the file and EVERYTHING else in the bucket are visible to EVERYONE on the internet.\nPre-Authenticated Requests Click on the three dots next to the file again and Click Create Pre-Authenticated Request: This gives you more options to control access and you can also expire the access :)\nAnd you then get a specific URL to access the file (or the bucket or the files you configured): The URL will stop working when it expires or when you delete the Request. You find all requests under Pre-Authenticated Requests in the Resources menu: Tiering Lifecycle Rules allow you to control what happens with files after a certain amount of time. You can delete them or move them to Archival storage for example: Mirroring Mirroring allows you to keep the bucket up-to-date with another bucket in another region (e.g. main bucket is in Europe and the replica is in Australia). This is controlled under the Replication Policy.\nYou first need to create the target bucket in the other region and then you can configure it as a target: Uploading files using CURL To enable this you need to create a Pre-Authenticated Request which allows access to the Bucket and it allows objects read and write and Object Listing: Then copy the URL, as it will never be shown again: Now you can use curl to upload files:\ncurl -v -X PUT --upload-file YOUR_FILE_HERE YOUR_PRE_AUTHENTICATED_REQUEST_URL_HERE Uploading files using RCLONE Rclone is a great tool for managing the remote file storages.

Replace REGION with the region where the storage bucket is located (e.g. eu-frankfurt-1).\nNow you can use rclone to for example list files in the bucket:\nrclone ls myobjectstorage:/test-bucket or you can upload files or whole directories (or download by reversing the order of Target/Source):\nrclone copy YOURFILE_or_YOURDIRECTORY myobjectstorage:/test-bucket or you can sync whole directories or other remote storage locations (includes deletes!):\nrclone sync YOURDIRECTORY_OR_YOUR_OTHER_RCLONE_STORAGE myobjectstorage:/test-bucket ","categories":"","description":"Object Storage\n","excerpt":"Object Storage\n","ref":"/brainhack_cloud/docs/object_storage/","tags":"","title":"Object Storage"},{"body":"Overview Access permissions are controlled via Policies.

One important thing to note is that Policies can ONLY be applied to Groups, NOT to the Users!\nPolicy for Cloud Shell access By default, a new user cannot open a Cloud Shell.
