## Overview

Object Storage is like Dropbox, but bigger ... it basically allows you to simply
store files and they can be accessible via links on the web (or APIs) and you
don't have to monitor the size of the disk (as opposed to block storage) and it
comes with very nice features for mirroring your data to other regions or
tiering data (making it cheaper to store if files are not accessed very often).

## Setup

## Preauthenticated URLs
